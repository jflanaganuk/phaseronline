# Resources needed
1. Level data - to be generated by tiled
2. Tileset - for the look of the level - can be placeholder for now. 32x32 or 24x24 i think is ideal
3. Player and Enemy sprites - should match dimensions of tileset
4. Pickup and bullet sprites - should match dimensions of tileset
5. Sounds - bxfr could generate
6. Music - royalty free or generate own
